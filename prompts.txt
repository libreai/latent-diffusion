an asteroid the size of a small mountain entering Earth's atmosphere
a star shining extremely bright in the sky of a big city at night
a comet passing in the sky of a big city in the night
a comet about to crash on Earth, seen from a suburban street
two small children holding hands, watching an asteroid about to crash on Earth
an extremely bright comet seen in the night sky from a hill
